🕌 **Excited to share my latest project: Quran Kareem - A comprehensive Islamic web application!** 🌙

I've just completed building a full-featured Islamic web app using React that serves the Muslim community with essential daily tools:

✨ **Key Features:**
🔹 **Complete Quran Reader** - Browse and listen to all 114 Surahs with audio recitation
🔹 **Prayer Times** - Real-time prayer schedules based on your location
🔹 **Daily Azkar** - Morning, evening, post-prayer, and sleep remembrances
🔹 **Audio Integration** - Listen to Quranic verses with beautiful recitation
🔹 **Responsive Design** - Modern UI with Arabic RTL support
🔹 **Location-based Services** - Automatic prayer time calculation

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- React 19 with Vite for fast development
- Lucide React for beautiful icons
- Multiple Islamic APIs integration
- Modern CSS with custom styling
- Geolocation services

This project combines my passion for technology with serving the Islamic community. The app provides essential daily tools for Muslims in a clean, accessible interface.

🎯 **What's Next?** Planning to add more features like Qibla direction, Islamic calendar events, and offline functionality.
